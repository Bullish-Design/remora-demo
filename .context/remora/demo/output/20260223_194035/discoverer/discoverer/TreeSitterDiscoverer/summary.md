The TreeSitterDiscoverer identifies and parses source files in specified languages by collecting matching files from root directories, loading language-specific queries, and parallelizing the parsing process to extract and deduplicate CST nodes. Its children handle directory traversal, language configuration, file grouping, and parallel parsing to efficiently discover and analyze source code.
