The File Root module orchestrates the extraction and deduplication of CST nodes from source files using the MatchExtractor class, which analyzes the parsed tree structure through compiled queries to identify, capture, and organize nodes with metadata such as type, name, and location. Its child component enables precise, pattern-based node extraction and structuring, forming the foundation for downstream code analysis.
