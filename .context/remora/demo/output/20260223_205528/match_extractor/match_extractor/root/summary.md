The File Root module orchestrates the extraction and deduplication of CST nodes from source files by leveraging the MatchExtractor class, which processes multiple compiled queries to identify, construct, and organize nodes based on capture patterns, then sorts them by file path, byte position, node type, and name. Its children enable precise, efficient parsing and structuring of code elements for downstream analysis.
