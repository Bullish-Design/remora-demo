The File Root orchestrates the AST Summary Engine's functionality by organizing and presenting a structured overview of Python code analysis, leveraging its children to demonstrate core features such as AST parsing, recursive summarization, real-time monitoring, and isolated environment execution. Its children collectively enable end-to-end code analysis by explaining the engine's mechanism, high-level capabilities, and implementation details.
