### File Summary

    The File Root defines a Python project named "ast-summary" with version 0.1.0, specifying its dependencies and development tools. It requires Pydantic and Tree-sitter for core functionality, includes optional tools like pytest and ruff for testing and code formatting, and configures both to align with Python 3.13 and project standards.

### File Summary

    The File Root orchestrates the AST Summary Engine's core functionality by organizing and presenting a hierarchical, structured overview of Python code through abstract syntax tree analysis. Its children—covering the engine's overview, features, and demonstration—detail how code is parsed, summarized recursively, and presented with real-time insights and workspace isolation.
