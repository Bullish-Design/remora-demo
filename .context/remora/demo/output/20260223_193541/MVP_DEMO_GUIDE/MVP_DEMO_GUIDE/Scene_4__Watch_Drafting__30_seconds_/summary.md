Scene 4: Watch Drafting (30 seconds) outlines the process of evaluating and refining a draft document, where the agent assesses an initial version, identifies improvements, and generates a superior refined draft (Draft 2) through iterative review. The children detail the initiation of evaluation, the inability to execute code due to incompleteness, and the successful refinement of the draft.
