1. **Workspace as Communication**: No stdin/stdout streaming. Agents write files, Neovim watches files.

2. **Physical Evidence**: Every agent action produces a file. User can see exactly what the agent researched, drafted, and decided.

3. **Interruptible**: User can browse workspace mid-execution. Agent can be stopped and resumed.

4. **Node Isolation**: Each AST node (function, class) gets its own workspace. No cross-contamination.

5. **Live Updates**: File watcher triggers UI refresh. Changes appear instantly.
