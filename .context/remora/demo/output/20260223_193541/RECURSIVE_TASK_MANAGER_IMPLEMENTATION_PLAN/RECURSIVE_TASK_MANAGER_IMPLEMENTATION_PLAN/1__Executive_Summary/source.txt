This document provides a detailed implementation plan for the **Recursive Decomposition Task Manager** as specified in `RECURSIVE_TASK_MANAGER_CONCEPT.md`. The plan maps the concept's models and workflows to Remora's existing infrastructure, identifies gaps, and provides concrete implementation steps.

**Assessment**: The concept is architecturally sound and aligns well with Remora's existing patterns. Approximately **60% of required infrastructure already exists**. The remaining 40% consists of:

- Task tree orchestration layer
- Sub-task spawning tools
- Hub-based task state persistence
- Verification/debugging loop automation

**Recommended Use**: Personal productivity tool and internal dogfooding, not initial MVP demo (too abstract for visual impact).
