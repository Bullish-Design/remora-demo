Phase 5: Architect Bundle defines a one-week phase to design and implement an agent bundle that breaks down complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks like linting, testing, and docstring generation using system prompts and few-shot examples, with the final deliverable being a functional and well-structured agent bundle. The child elements specify the task decomposition, implementation approach, and expected outcomes.
