The Recursive Task Manager concept is well-designed and maps cleanly onto Remora's existing architecture. The implementation requires:

1. **New code**: ~1,500 lines (models, task manager, tools)
2. **Extended code**: ~300 lines (workspace, coordinator, CLI)
3. **Dependencies**: Complete Hub daemon implementation

**Total estimated effort**: 6-8 weeks for full implementation

**Recommendation**: Begin with Phase 1 (Foundation Models) as it has no dependencies and provides immediate value for task tracking. Defer full recursive execution to post-MVP when Hub daemon is complete.
