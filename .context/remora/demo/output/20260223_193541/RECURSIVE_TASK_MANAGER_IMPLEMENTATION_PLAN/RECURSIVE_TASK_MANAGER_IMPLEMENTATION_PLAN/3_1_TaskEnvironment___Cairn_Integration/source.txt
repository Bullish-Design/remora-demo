**Existing Component**: `src/remora/workspace.py` (WorkspaceCache, WorkspaceState)

**Current Capabilities:**

- Workspace creation via `cairn.Workspace()`
- File isolation and resource limits
- Accept/reject/retry state machine
- Workspace pooling for performance

**Required Extensions:**

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Add `parent_workspace_id` field to workspace metadata
2. Create workspace bridge that can mount parent workspace as read-only overlay
3. Add context key filtering to limit what Hub keys the agent can access
