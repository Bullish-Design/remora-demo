The Recursive Execution Loop enables agents to iteratively refine development goals through context exploration, tool-based searches, and specialized sub-task execution, using a sandboxed environment and high-quality code from a Golden Reference Library to generate and validate solutions. Its children enable dynamic, traceable reasoning by breaking down tasks, executing actions, and leveraging external code references within a secure, recursive framework.
