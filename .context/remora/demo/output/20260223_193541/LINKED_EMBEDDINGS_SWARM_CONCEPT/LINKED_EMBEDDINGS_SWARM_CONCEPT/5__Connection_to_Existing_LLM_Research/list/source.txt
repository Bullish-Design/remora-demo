*   **Code Property Graphs (CPGs)**: The idea of merging ASTs (Structural/Code Space) with semantic relationships (Control Flow and Data Flow) is well-established in research as Code Property Graphs. The Linked Embeddings approach takes this a step further by explicitly storing these facets in distinct, queryable vector spaces for agentic navigation.
*   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Current research utilizes GNNs to learn "structure-aware node embeddings"—dense vectors that capture both the properties of individual code nodes and their relational edges within the AST or CPG.
*   **Tree-based Positional Embeddings**: Models are increasingly moving away from linear token sequences, using Tree-sitter ASTs to explicitly encode hierarchical relationships (like nested loops or depth) into the multidimensional embeddings.
