This section outlines Remora's architecture and capabilities for bridging paper-based research with practical implementation, demonstrating how its integration of LLMs, recursive environment modeling, and advanced execution features enhances Python REPL functionality through dynamic, self-improving simulations and efficient, structured communication. The children detail the effectiveness of the approach, the recursive framework, and the technical components enabling real-time, scalable, and intelligent program execution.
