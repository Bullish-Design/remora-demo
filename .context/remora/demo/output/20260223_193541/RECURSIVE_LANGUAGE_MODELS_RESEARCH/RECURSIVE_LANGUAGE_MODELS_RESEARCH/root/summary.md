The File Root serves as the central organizational structure for a research report on Recursive Language Models (RLMs), integrating foundational concepts, architectural design, evaluation methods, implementation strategies, and system limitations to present a comprehensive, scalable, and cost-effective framework for enhancing long-context language understanding through recursive, code-execution-based reasoning. Its children collectively define the RLM architecture, demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency across benchmarks, detail implementation and optimization techniques, and highlight both successes and critical challenges in achieving robust, autonomous, and reliable recursive language modeling.
