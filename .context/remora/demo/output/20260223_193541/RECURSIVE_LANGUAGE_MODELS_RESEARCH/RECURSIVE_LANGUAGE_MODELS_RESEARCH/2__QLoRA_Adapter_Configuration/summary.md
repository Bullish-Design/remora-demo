This heading outlines the configuration of QLoRA adapters for fine-tuning large language models on resource-constrained hardware, leveraging 4-bit quantization and low-rank adaptation to efficiently train models for RLM navigation by optimizing linear layers for complex REPL syntax and tool-calling while minimizing VRAM usage. The child elements explain QLoRA's efficiency benefits and specify the adapter settings that enable effective, memory-efficient fine-tuning.
