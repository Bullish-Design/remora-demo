These benchmarks evaluate different aspects of large language model performance: S-NIAH tests precise fact retrieval in large texts, BrowseComp-Plus assesses multi-hop reasoning, OOLONG and OOLONG-Pairs measure semantic aggregation with linear and quadratic complexity respectively, while Context Compaction and CodeAct represent baseline methods that either summarize or execute code within a full context, with the RLM outperforming them significantly.
