The Core RLM System Prompt Structure defines the foundational rules and workflow for an RLM system, ensuring the model operates within strict boundaries and follows a structured, recursive process for data processing using syntactic guidelines, examples, and clear termination conditions. Its children establish sandbox constraints, define recursive query procedures, and provide examples and termination logic to guide accurate and consistent model behavior.
