This Heading3 element outlines a spatial recursion framework where the Root Architect uses a queryable AST to navigate code structure and spawns specialized sub-environments for targeted refactoring, enabling recursive, decentralized code analysis through context-aware agent tasks. The children detail the AST traversal mechanism, refactoring process, sub-environment spawning, implementation mappings, and the agent architecture that collectively enable flexible, scalable, and context-specific code manipulation.
