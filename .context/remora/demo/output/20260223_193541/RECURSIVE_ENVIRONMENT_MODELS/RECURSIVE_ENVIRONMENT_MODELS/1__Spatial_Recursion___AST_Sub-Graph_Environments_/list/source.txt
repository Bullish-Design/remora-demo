*   **Agent Bundles Required:**
    *   `architect`: The Root Agent. Loaded with `function_gemma` and an `architect-v1` LoRA. It is the only agent that receives the global `ast_graph`.
    *   `node_implementer`: The spawned worker agent. It is passed specific `node_ids` to construct its localized Cairn Workspace Bridge.
*   **Grail Tools (`.pym`) Required:**
    *   `query_ast.pym`:
        *   **Functionality:** Allows the Architect to write and execute basic python traversal scripts against the Tree-sitter AST Graph object in its sandbox.
        *   **Inputs:** `script: str` (The Python execution sequence).
        *   **Outputs:** JSON representation of discovered `TreeNode` objects (IDs, types, and file locations).
    *   `spawn_node_environment.pym`:
        *   **Functionality:** The trigger to initiate the fan-out recursion. Tells the `Coordinator` to batch new tasks for the identified nodes.
        *   **Inputs:** `node_ids: list[str]`, `target_agent: str` (e.g., `"node_implementer"`), `intent: str`.
        *   **Outputs:** `task_ids: list[str]` representing the newly spawned sub-tasks on the Hub daemon.
