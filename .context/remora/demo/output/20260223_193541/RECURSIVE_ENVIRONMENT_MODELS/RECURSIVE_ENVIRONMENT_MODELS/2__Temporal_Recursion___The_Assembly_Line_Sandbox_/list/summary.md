This system orchestrates a pipeline where the `planner` drafts an implementation plan, the `implementer` executes code changes using Grail commands, and if tests fail, the `debugger` is spawned via `spawn_debugging_environment.pym` to analyze errors and diffs. The `transition_phase.pym` tool enables task switching between agent bundles by suspending the current task and passing constraints to the next phase.
