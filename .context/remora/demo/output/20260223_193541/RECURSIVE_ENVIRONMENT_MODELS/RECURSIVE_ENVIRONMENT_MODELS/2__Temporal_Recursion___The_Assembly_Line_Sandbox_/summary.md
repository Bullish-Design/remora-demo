This Heading3 introduces "Temporal Recursion: The Assembly Line Sandbox" as a framework that models a feature's lifecycle through recursive temporal progression, where each phase—planning, implementation, and debugging—is dynamically orchestrated and refined. Its children detail how recursion advances through time, how environments are constructed and refined, and how the system pipelines tasks across planners, implementers, and debuggers using defined mappings and phase transitions.
