This heading outlines how Recursive Environment Models (REM) enhance decision-making in complex environments and enable targeted, parallel refactoring in large codebases through dynamically created, LoRA-tuned Micro-Environments coordinated via a shared KV memory bus. The children explain the REM's role in environmental prediction and its application in Remora for efficient, context-aware codebase manipulation.
