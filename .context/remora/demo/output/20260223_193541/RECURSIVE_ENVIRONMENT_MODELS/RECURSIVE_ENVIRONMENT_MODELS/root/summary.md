The File Root defines and integrates Recursive Environment Models (REMs) as a framework for advanced, context-aware, and recursively structured code analysis and manipulation, leveraging syntactic parsing, decentralized agent tasks, temporal progression, and shared memory for scalable, dynamic, and parallel codebase interactions. Its children detail the technical components, architectural mechanisms, and recursive workflows that enable deep, structured, and intelligent processing of code through AST navigation, sandboxed sub-environments, temporal lifecycle modeling, and real-time context sharing.
