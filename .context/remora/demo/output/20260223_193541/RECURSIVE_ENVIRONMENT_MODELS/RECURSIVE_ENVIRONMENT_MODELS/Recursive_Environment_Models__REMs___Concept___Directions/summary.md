This heading introduces Recursive Environment Models (REMs) as a concept that combines Recursive Language Models with Remora's architecture to enhance language understanding through syntactic and semantic recursion, leveraging KV caching, sandboxed execution, and tree-sitter-based AST analysis. Its child elements detail the integration approach and technical components that enable deeper recursive processing.
