This heading introduces the evolution from traditional RLMs to advanced Recursive Environment Models (REMs), which enable dynamic, context-aware, and sandboxed interactions through Grail and Cairn. The children illustrate how RLMs simplify environment interactions via linear history, how REMs enable structured, scoped sub-tasks, and how a tree-sitter-based parsing framework with swarm intelligence transforms code syntax into actionable insights through distributed processing.
