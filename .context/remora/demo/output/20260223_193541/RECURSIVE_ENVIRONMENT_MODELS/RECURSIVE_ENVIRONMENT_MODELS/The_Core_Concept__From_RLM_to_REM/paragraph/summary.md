The provided code demonstrates a tree-sitter-based parsing and analysis framework applied to assembly-line concepts, enabling structured extraction and transformation of code syntax into actionable insights through a swarm intelligence approach. It leverages tree-sitter's syntax parsing to model code structure and applies feature-based assembly-line logic to generate or optimize code transformations in a distributed, parallel processing environment.
