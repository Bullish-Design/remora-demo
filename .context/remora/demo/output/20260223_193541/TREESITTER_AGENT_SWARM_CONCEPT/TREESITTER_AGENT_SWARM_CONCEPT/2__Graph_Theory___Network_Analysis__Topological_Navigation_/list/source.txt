* **PageRank (Code Importance Scoring):** Instead of ranking web pages, the system ranks AST nodes by their "Incoming Data Flow" and "Call Frequency." A utility function called by 50 other functions has a massive PageRank. If a user asks to "optimize the codebase," the Supervisor LoRA runs PageRank, identifies the critical choke-point nodes, and assigns agents specifically to those high-value targets.
* **Dijkstra's or A* Search (Data Flow Pathfinding):** Finding the semantic path between two AST nodes. If a developer highlights a UI button and says "make this button save to the cloud," the agent uses A* to pathfind the data flow from the UI node to the Database node, identifying exactly which intermediate `controller` and `service` nodes need to be assigned sub-agents to bridge the gap.
* **Graph Partitioning / Community Detection (Louvain Method):** Detecting clusters of tightly coupled nodes that form a "feature" or "domain" (e.g., all nodes related to 'billing'). A Domain Agent uses this to suggest where to split a monolithic file into smaller, decoupled microservices.
