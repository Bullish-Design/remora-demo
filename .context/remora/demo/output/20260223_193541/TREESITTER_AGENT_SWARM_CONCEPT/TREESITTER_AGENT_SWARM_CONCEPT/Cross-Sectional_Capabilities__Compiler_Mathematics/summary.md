This heading outlines the compiler mathematics capabilities enabled by the Swarm architecture and FunctionGemma models, which leverage AST analysis and Grail scripts to perform advanced mathematical operations on codebases. The children detail how AST analysis across four dimensions and execution of graph theory, linear algebra, and vector calculus through Grail scripts enable sophisticated compiler-level reasoning.
