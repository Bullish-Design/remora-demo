This heading introduces vector space mathematics for cross-modal search and semantic arithmetic, enabling agents to perform algebraic operations on embeddings to retrieve, combine, and infer code concepts. Its children detail how semantic queries are projected into latent spaces for cross-modal retrieval and how vector arithmetic generates implementation templates through concept manipulation and database lookup.
