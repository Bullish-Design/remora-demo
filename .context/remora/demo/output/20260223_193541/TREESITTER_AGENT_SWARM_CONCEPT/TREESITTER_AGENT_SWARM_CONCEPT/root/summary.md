The File Root defines a decentralized, swarm-based agent system for Remora that leverages Tree-sitter's AST as a coordination graph to enable efficient, context-aware code processing and transformation. Its children collectively enable intelligent, multi-modal code analysis through fine-tuned models, graph theory, vector mathematics, and Neovim integration, while supporting decentralized execution, mathematical reasoning, and dataset-driven model training.
