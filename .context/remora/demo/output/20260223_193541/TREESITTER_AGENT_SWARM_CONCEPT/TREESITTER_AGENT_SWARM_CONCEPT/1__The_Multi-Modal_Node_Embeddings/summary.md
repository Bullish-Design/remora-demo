This heading introduces a multi-modal node embedding approach that represents each node in an AST as a composite embedding across multiple vector spaces, capturing structural, behavioral, and contextual aspects through source code, documentation, and graph connectivity. Its children detail how each node's embedding is defined by its source, inputs/outputs, and position within the computational graph.
