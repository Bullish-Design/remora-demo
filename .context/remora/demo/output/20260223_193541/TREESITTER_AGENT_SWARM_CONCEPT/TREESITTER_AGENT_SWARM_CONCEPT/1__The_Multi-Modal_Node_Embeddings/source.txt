Each node within the AST is embedded across multiple linked vector spaces, representing different conceptual dimensions:

* **Syntax (Code):** The literal source code text of the node.
* **Semantics (Comments):** Summaries and docstrings associated with or generated for the node.
* **Types / Signatures:** The structural inputs and outputs matching the node.
* **Topology (Graph):** Its structural relationship to other nodes (parent, children, siblings, data flow).
