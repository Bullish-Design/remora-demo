The Dataset Generation Strategy defines a pipeline to create specialized datasets by analyzing Python repositories through AST parsing and LLM-generated metadata, enabling fine-tuning of lightweight reasoning models with high precision and low computational cost. Its children provide the data curation, analysis, and dataset splitting processes that power this targeted model training.
