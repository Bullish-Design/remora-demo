1. **Intent Decoding (The Supervisor LoRA):**
   * The user's natural language request and the highlighted AST nodes are passed to a dynamic Supervisor LoRA.
   * This LoRA deciphers the intent, researches the implications across the linked embedding spaces using Graph Partitioning, and creates a master Plan.
   * It defines the **Final Desired State** of the codebase graph.

2. **Test-Driven Initialization:**
   * Before any code is changed, specialized agent pairs are spun up to calculate Bayesian Infection probabilities and generate unit tests defining the successful completion of the Final Desired State.

3. **Graph Subcontracting (Fan-Out Execution):**
   * The Supervisor hands the entrypoint Task to the Agent responsible for the top-level highlighted node.
   * **Down-leveling:** If the top-level Agent (e.g., a Class Agent) needs its internal functions modified, it "subcontracts" those tasks to the specific Function Agents responsible for its child nodes.
   * **Lateral Negotiation:** If a Function Agent realizes it needs a new utility, it can request its sibling nodes, or use A* Pathfinding to traverse the Graph Embedding space and request changes from completely different files/nodes.
   * **Upstream Resolution:** Once child nodes complete their sandboxed generation and tests pass, they pass the finalized state back up to their parent nodes for integration.
