This system uses a Supervisor LoRA to interpret natural language requests and define a Final Desired State for a codebase through intent decoding and graph-based reasoning. It then employs test-driven initialization and graph subcontracting—enabling hierarchical task delegation, lateral collaboration via A* pathfinding, and upstream integration—to safely and efficiently evolve the codebase while ensuring correctness through automated unit tests.
