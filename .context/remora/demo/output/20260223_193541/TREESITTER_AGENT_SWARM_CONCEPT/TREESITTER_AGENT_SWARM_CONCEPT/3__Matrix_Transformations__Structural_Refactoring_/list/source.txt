* **Isomorphism Checking (Pattern Matching):** Checking if two subgraphs (matrices) are structurally identical, regardless of variable names. A Refactoring Agent uses an `isomorphism.pym` script to scan the codebase for subgraphs that match known anti-patterns (nested loops that could be comprehensions) or to entirely deduplicate logic across the repo.
* **AST Matrix Multiplication (Dependency Resolution):** If Matrix $A$ represents "Function Calls" and Matrix $B$ represents "Variable Dependencies", computing $AB$ reveals indirect dependencies. A `dependency_matrix_calc.pym` script allows an agent to instantly calculate the "blast radius" of changing a specific parameter without having to manually read through downstream files.
