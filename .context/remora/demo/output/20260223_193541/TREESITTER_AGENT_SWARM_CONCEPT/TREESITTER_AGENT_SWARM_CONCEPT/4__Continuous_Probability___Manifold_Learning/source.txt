When an agent needs to understand a massive, complex file or make bets on changes:

* **UMAP / t-SNE (Codebase Cartography):** Reducing the 1536-dimensional node embeddings down to 2D/3D space while preserving local relationships. The Supervisor uses this to cluster the entire codebase. When building a new feature, it looks at the manifold to see where similar concepts "live" and decides which existing module the new code should be injected into.
* **Markov Random Fields / Bayesian Infection Propagation:** Modeling probability across the AST. If Node A is modified and has a 20% chance of throwing a new Exception, how does that probability propagate through the graph to Node Z? The Test Generation Agent uses this mathematical model to determine *exactly* which edge cases to test. Instead of random unit tests, it generates tests for the nodes with the highest mathematical probability of state corruption.
