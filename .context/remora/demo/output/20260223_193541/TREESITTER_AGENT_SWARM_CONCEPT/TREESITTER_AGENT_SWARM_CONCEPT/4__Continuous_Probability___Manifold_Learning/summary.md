This heading introduces the integration of continuous probability and manifold learning techniques in code analysis, where the agent breaks down complex code into manageable parts for evaluation. Children contribute by enabling structured analysis through component-wise assessment and using UMAP/t-SNE and Markov Random Fields to visualize code structure, identify semantic regions, and generate targeted tests based on probabilistic failure modeling.
