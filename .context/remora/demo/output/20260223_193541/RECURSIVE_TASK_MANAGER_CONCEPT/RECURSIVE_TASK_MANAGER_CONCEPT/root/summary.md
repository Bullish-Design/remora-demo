The File Root orchestrates a recursive, type-safe task management system by defining core data structures, execution environments, and orchestration layers that enable adaptive, self-referential learning through dynamic task decomposition and synchronized state management across isolated workspaces. Its children collectively establish the conceptual, structural, and operational foundations for safe, reliable, and scalable task execution and refinement.
