The language pack concept requires:

- Fine-tuned EmbeddingGemma with MRL
- CodeGemma 2B with LoRA
- T5Gemma for transformations
- FunctionGemma for orchestration

Four different model architectures is too complex for MVP. We simplify to FunctionGemma-only with prompt engineering for different roles.
