**TREESITTER_AGENT_SWARM_CONCEPT** (Your Favorite #1)

- *Strengths:* Visually stunning, demonstrates deep compiler mathematics, showcases vLLM batched inference
- *Challenges:* Requires training dozens of node-specific LoRA adapters, complex coordination infrastructure
- *MVP Potential:* **High if scoped down** to 3-4 node types instead of "every AST node"

**COMPREHENSIVE_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL_SUITE** (Your Favorite #2)

- *Strengths:* Complete "Language Pack" distribution story, impressive multi-model orchestration
- *Challenges:* Requires EmbeddingGemma, CodeGemma, T5Gemma, and FunctionGemma trained/fine-tuned
- *MVP Potential:* **Medium** - could demo with mock/base models, but loses impact

**FEATURE_ASSEMBLY_LINE_CONCEPT**

- *Strengths:* Clear business value, understandable workflow, parallel execution visible
- *Challenges:* Requires 5 specialized agents, test validation loop
- *MVP Potential:* **High** - aligns well with existing infrastructure
