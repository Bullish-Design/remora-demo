The full swarm concept requires:

- Training 50+ node-specific LoRA adapters
- Implementing Louvain community detection
- Building Bayesian infection propagation
- Creating vector arithmetic tooling

This is 6-12 months of work. The MVP extracts the most impressive elements (AST visualization, multi-agent coordination) without requiring the full mathematical infrastructure.
