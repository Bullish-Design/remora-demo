**Concept:** Drastically simplified TREESITTER_AGENT_SWARM

**Demo Flow:**

1. User selects a single function in codebase
2. Show 3 specialized agents analyzing it:
   - Structure Agent (AST analysis)
   - Style Agent (linting/formatting)
   - Doc Agent (docstring generation)
3. Agents communicate via shared workspace
4. Final merged result

**Pros:** Most faithful to your favorite concept, achievable scope
**Cons:** Less impressive than full swarm vision

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks
