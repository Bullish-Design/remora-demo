The **Code Evolution Pipeline** demo represents the optimal balance of:

1. **Visual Impact** - Live dashboard with AST navigation and agent coordination
2. **Technical Differentiation** - LoRA hot-swapping is unique and impressive
3. **Achievable Scope** - Builds on existing infrastructure
4. **Business Relevance** - Clear enterprise use case

**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. Approve this concept and begin Phase 1
2. Set up vLLM development environment with LoRA support
3. Create initial dashboard prototype
4. Define specific training data for adapter fine-tuning

The demo should be ready for internal presentation in 4 weeks, with another 2 weeks for polish before external audiences.
