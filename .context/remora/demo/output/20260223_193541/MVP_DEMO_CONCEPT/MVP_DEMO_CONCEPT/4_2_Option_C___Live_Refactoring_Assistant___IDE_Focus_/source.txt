**Concept:** Simplified version of LEARNING_ASSISTANT_CONCEPT

**Demo Flow:**

1. Open VS Code/Neovim with Remora LSP
2. Hover over function - see rich context
3. Select code - request refactoring
4. Watch agents collaborate to refactor
5. Accept/reject changes inline

**Pros:** Very relatable for developers, IDE integration impressive
**Cons:** Requires LSP implementation, harder to present to non-technical audience

**Effort:** 5-7 weeks
