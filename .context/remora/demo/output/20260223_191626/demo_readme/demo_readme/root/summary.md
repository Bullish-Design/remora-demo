The File Root orchestrates the AST Summary Engine's core functionality by organizing and presenting a structured, hierarchical analysis of Python code through its abstract syntax tree. Its children—covering the engine's overview, features, and demonstration—detail how the system parses code, generates recursive summaries, monitors progress, and executes isolated environments to deliver comprehensive, actionable insights.
