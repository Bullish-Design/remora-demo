## demo_math.py

The File Root module organizes and executes a basic arithmetic calculator application by leveraging the Calculator class to perform mathematical operations and the main function to initiate and display the results of those operations.

## demo_config.toml

The File Root defines a Python project named "ast-summary" with version 0.1.0, specifying its dependencies and development tools. It requires Pydantic and Tree-sitter for core functionality, includes optional tools like pytest and ruff for testing and code formatting, and configures both to align with Python 3.13 and a 120-character line length.

## demo_readme.md

The File Root orchestrates the AST Summary Engine's core functionality by organizing and presenting a structured, hierarchical analysis of Python code through its abstract syntax tree. Its children—covering the engine's overview, features, and demonstration—detail how the system parses code, generates recursive summaries, monitors progress, and executes isolated environments to deliver comprehensive, actionable insights.
