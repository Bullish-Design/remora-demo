The File Root orchestrates the presentation and functionality of the AST Summary Demo by structuring content around key sections: introducing the AST Summary feature, detailing the engine's code analysis process, and outlining its core capabilities such as multi-format parsing, recursive summarization, real-time monitoring, and isolated environment execution. Its children collectively enable a comprehensive, structured exploration of Python code's syntax and semantics through systematic breakdown and visualization.
