# Roadmap Notes

## Short Term

- Expand the component library to cover more dashboard layouts.
- Add more interactive agents that pause for human approval.
- Improve observability for large, multi-graph runs.

## Mid Term

The next milestone focuses on cross-project workflows. This includes richer
graph planning, better dependency visualization, and structured summaries that
can be persisted to external systems.

## Long Term

Remora aims to become the coordination layer for multi-agent workflows across
heterogeneous repositories. The long-term vision includes durable event replay,
pluggable model adapters, and robust audit trails.
